# Project Rules: Orchids-2api

## Authorized Actions
- **Git Operations**: All `git` commands are fully authorized (init, add, commit, push, branch, etc.).
- **Go Development**: All `go` commands are authorized (build, test, run, fmt, mod, etc.).
- **System & File Operations**: Common Unix utilities (`ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `grep`, `find`, `sed`, `awk`, `ps`, `kill`, etc.) are authorized for workspace management.
- **Node.js/Frontend**: `npm`, `npx`, `node`, `yarn`, and `pnpm` are authorized if needed for frontend tasks.
- **Networking**: `curl` and `wget` are permitted for external API interactions.
- **Workflows**: Automated synchronization via `.agent/workflows/` is encouraged for complex task execution.

## Security & Reliability
- Always verify the build (`go build`) before pushing changes.
- Maintain diagnostic logging patterns in `internal/debug/`.
- Do not commit secrets or credentials.
